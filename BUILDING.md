# Building Cartool from sources

## Tools

Visual Studio 2019 is the compiler currently used.
Visual Studio 2015 might work for Cartool itlself, but maybe not for all dependencies.
Visual Studio 2022 ought to be working, but no project is offered for the moment

## Dependencies

- OpenGL
- IntelÂ® OneMKL
- Armadillo
- OpenMP
- pcre 7
- OwlNext 7
