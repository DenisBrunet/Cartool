**Cartool** is a software primarily designed as a scientific tool tailored for the **visualization and analysis of EEG data**, encompassing full recordings, resting states, evoked responses, intra-cranial activity, and more.

It enables seamless real-time integration of diverse modalities such as EEG, electrodes, and MRI. Offering an array of tools, including preprocessing for EEG, electrodes, and MRI, as well as frequency and micro-states analysis, and electrical source imaging.

Developed in C++ for _Windows_, Cartool is highly optimized for parallel processing, has a very small memory footprint, and very few dependencies. It has been under continuous development since 1997, originally from the [**Functional Brain Mapping Lab**](https://www.google.ch/search?q="functional+brain+mapping"+fbmlab+geneva), Geneva, Switzerland, and since 2024, from the [**Geneva University Hospital**](https://www.unige.ch/medecine/neucli/groupes-de-recherche/serge-vulliemoz) and [**CIBM**](https://cibm.ch/research/software/), Switzerland.
