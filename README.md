**Cartool** is a software primarily designed as a scientific tool tailored for the **visualization and analysis of EEG data**, encompassing full recordings, resting states, evoked responses, intra-cranial activity, and more.

It enables seamless real-time integration of diverse modalities such as EEG, electrodes, and MRI. Offering an array of tools, including preprocessing for EEG, electrodes, and MRI, as well as frequency and micro-states analysis, and electrical source imaging.

Developed in C++ for Windows, Cartool is highly optimized for parallel processing, has a very small memory footprint, and very few dependencies. It has been undergoing continuous development since 1996, thanks to the [_Functional Brain Mapping_](https://neurocenter-unige.ch/research-groups/christoph-michel/), Geneva, and [_CIBM_](https://www.cibm.ch), Lausanne.
