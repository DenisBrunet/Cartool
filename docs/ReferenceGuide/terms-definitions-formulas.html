             root of the mean of the squared differences between the potentials
             measured at all corresponding electrodes. Since only landscape
             differences are of interest, the maps are first scaled to unitary
             strength by dividing the voltage at each electrode by the GFP:<IMG SRC="images/formul5.png" ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="217" HEIGHT="131" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> with<IMG SRC="images/formul6.png" ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="137" HEIGHT="99" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0">and<IMG SRC="images/formul7.png" ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="135" HEIGHT="99" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0">

         <P>
             The Dissimilarity ranges from 0 to 2. Diss=2 means that the two maps
             are inverted, Diss=0 means that they are similar.<BR>
             Dissimilarity and Global Field Power have been developed by Lehmann
             &amp; Skrandies, 1980.<BR>

             <A NAME="correlation"></A>The <B>Spatial Correlation</B> between two
             maps is mathematically defined as:<BR>
             <IMG SRC="images/formul8.png" ALIGN=CENTER VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"><BR>
             The relation between Dissimilarity and correlation has been developed
             by Brandeis et al., 1992. He showed that:<BR>
             <IMG SRC="images/formul9.png" ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="179" HEIGHT="80" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0">or<IMG SRC="images/formul10.png" ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="168" HEIGHT="98" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"><BR>
             Correlation ranges from -1 to +1. C = -1 means that the two maps are
             inverted, C = +1 means that they are similar.<BR>
             <BR>
             <BR>
             <BR>
             <BR>
             The <B>Explained Variance (EV)</B> gives the amount of variance over
             all electrodes of a given map that is explained by another map. It is
             calculated as:<BR>
             <IMG SRC="images/formul11.png" ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="372" HEIGHT="162" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"><BR>
             Therefor, the relation between correlation and explained variance is
             the same as between the two statistical values variance and standard deviation:<BR>

         <P>
             <A NAME="GEV"></A>The <B>Global Explained Variance (GEV)</B> is NOT
             just the mean of the explained variances over a time period and is
             NOT the mean correlation of the segment map in the time period. The
             global explained variance is the sum of the explained variances
             WEIGHTED by the Global Field Power at each moment in time:<BR>
             <IMG SRC="images/formul14.png" ALIGN=CENTER VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"><BR>
             Thus, a map that explains a short period with high GFP might have a
             higher GEV than a map that explains a long time period with low GFP.
         </P>
         <P>
             It is worth mentioning that the summation of all time frames can also
             be split into contributions for each segment (in which the segment
             map is constant). Then, for <I>q</I> segments/clusters:<BR>

             OpenGL is a standard and very powerful graphic library for 3D
             rendering, first developped by Silicon Graphics, then transferred to
             other platforms. OpenGL is evolving, so it has a version number
             associated with it. Cartool right now is compatible with version 1.1
             and higher.
         </P>
         <P>
             It is nearly mandatory to have a graphic cards that will accelerate
             OpenGL operations to have decent performance. Though you can
             theoretically work without... but I warned you.
