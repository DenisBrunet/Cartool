             The method works this way, with the 2 first stages being the main ones:

                 <P ALIGN=LEFT>
                     Coregistration is done by minimizing the sum of the squared distances
                     between the same electrodes, with a global optimization process. The
                     transformation function has 7 parameters (3 for translations, 3 for
                     rotations, 1 for global scaling).

         <P ALIGN=LEFT>
             The method is insensitive to which file is picked first in the first
             stage, apart for a slight different global scaling.
         </P>
         <P ALIGN=LEFT>
             The number of repetitions of the second stage is currently set to 3,
             as the resulting average does not evolve significantly afterward.
         </P>
         <P ALIGN=LEFT>
             Only a global scaling is allowed, and not 3 different scalings for
             each axis. We want to average the <I>shape</I> of the heads, and
             having different factors in x, y or z <I>does</I> alter the original
             shape. Plus, it would make the whole process very dependent to which
             file is picked in the first stage.
