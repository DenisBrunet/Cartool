                     Go in the advanced properties of the Display, and remove all
                     accelerations. Run again Cartool, if it works, the problem is
                     definitely on the graphic card side! (see points 1 and 2).

                     The graphic card has to be <A HREF="terms-definitions-formulas.html#OpenGL">OpenGL</A>
                     compliant, but even if it says so, each manufacturer has its own
                     interpretation of the standard. So try to tune the display setting in
                     the advanced properties. Usually, I recommend setting things for
                     &quot;Fast&quot; rather than &quot;Quality&quot; performances, or
                     something like &quot;Application preferences&quot;.

                     Still it may not work properly, although it works on other computers,
                     then you really have a problem! Either wait for the next driver
                     (points 1, 2, 3), especially if you card is brand new. Or you simply
                     need to change the graphic card, and&nbsp; it is worth putting a
                     little extra money on it. The more it accelerates features by
                     hardware, the better. You can also keep the card when
                     upgrading/changing your PC.
                 </P>

                 <P>
                     If you don't have an accelerated card, that means you rely on the
                     software library provided in Windows (opengl32.dll). It <I>does</I>
                     behave strangely with demanding applications like Cartool, and
                     especially if you are running short of memory. I can't do anything
                     for you, apart from telling you again to buy a graphic card.

             The display is slow:

                     In Cartool, go in <FONT FACE="Arial Black,Arial,Helvetica">Help|About</FONT>,
                     and see if Cartool recognizes the graphic adapter. If not, it may
                     not be installed correctly (drivers...) or it may be turned off
                     (display settings again).

                     Try to tune up the properties of the OpenGL. It may change from card
                     to card, but try to remove any anti-aliasing, and select for speed,
                     not quality.

             It doesn't print correctly:
         </H3>
         <P>
             Cartool is not really tuned for printing, though it has the ability.
             Unfortunately, the Microsoft implementation of OpenGL is known to be
             buggy, and can not print correctly. To bypass this, do some &quot;copy
             as bitmaps&quot; and paste in some application, then print. Sorry,
             that's all for now, I will fix this later.

                     Make sure you are using the 64bit edition of Cartool, which is highly
                     optimized for speed, and not some old 32bit version.

                     You must have enough memory to avoid as much as possible memory
                     swapping on the disk. The more the memory, the better, especially if
                     you work with big volumes. Minimum is 512M, I'd say, 1G is fine for now.

                     Try to optimize the swap file (known as <I>page file</I> in windows),
                     either with some third party utility, or using the following trick.
                     Set page file to 0 (control panel / system / advanced / performance
                     options), ignoring warning messages, reboot, then defrag your disk.
                     Set back the page file to its original amount, reboot again. This
                     will provide a fresh, unfragmented page file, which can really boost
                     your machine again!

                     It may not be very efficient to have multiple instances of Cartool
                     running at the same time, though it works.

             The program crashes immediately when started
         </H4>
         <P>
             Presently, you must have Administrator rights to run Cartool, because
             it updates the Windows registry. If it is not the case, try this. Do
             a shortcut to Cartool.exe on the desktop, and edit its properties. In
             the Target field, after the Cartool.exe, add <B>/noregister</B> to
             avoid touching the registry. Then use this shortcut to launch
             Cartool. Note that Cartool has to be run <B>at least once</B> as an
             Administrator to create the file associations for Windows.
         </P>

             The Explorer can not open anymore the files when double-clicking

         <P ALIGN=LEFT>
             Cartool registers all its known file extensions to Windows, and each
             time it is run. If you happen to have multiple versions of Cartool on
             your machine, then each version tries to steal the registry for
             itself at each run time. You finish with a real mess, and
             double-clicking may open an unexpected version of Cartool (therefor
             leading to some misunderstandings and/or errors), or simply does not
             work anymore. Open the correct Cartool version, then <A HREF="cartool-options.html#registration-reset">
                 reset
                 the registry
             </A>.
