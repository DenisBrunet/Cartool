"Container" classes for arrays of dimensions 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4 and n.
They handle the memory allocation and elements access.
They all make use of the TMemory class, which optimally allocates
memory on the most convenient place, but usually the virtual memory.

These are header-only files, just include it into your source files.
